# worldbuilding
keeping track of all the material i want to put into the worldbuilding part of the site
I've got three worlds at least to keep track of: Falyns, Clockwork Coast, and Thought Woman Adventure Club.  TWAC will include Woodland and Tarot since they are minor worlds and can be generated from the play of the kids in the TWAC at different ages.  IDEA--telling those stories can be a part of the way I publish fragments and build character. Or tell stories about making up stories which is another use for the site.
